Use case: View transaction history

Primary Actor: User

Stakeholders and Their Goals:
User: The user would like to know what he has purchased and earned over some 
past temporal period.
Database: The database will need to provide the specifics of each transaction.

Post Conditions: 
The user will have obtained the desired information, and the database can cease 
providing the information for this activity.

Main Success Scenario:
1. The user runs the application, already installed, on his android device.
2. The user has an account with which he has cataloged numerous deposits and 
withdrawals.
3. The user navigates to the "history" menu option.
4. The database provides the user with information regarding his twenty most 
recent transactions.
5. The user wishes to view the specifics of a purchase, so he selects it, and
the application displays the item in detail.
6. The user navigates away from the transaction by selecting the "back" button, 
the history tab by selecting a different tab, or exits the application, having 
viewed the information he meant to.

Extensions or Alternate Flows:
2. If the user is new and has not cataloged any transactions, then the database
contains no history of the user, and there are no associated transactions.
4. If the user has not made 20 transactions, then the displayed record contains
only as many as he has (0 to 19).
4. If the user wishes to view purchases over a time period as opposed to twenty
most recent, he can do so by specifying beginning and ending dates using 
provided menus.
4. If the user wishes to configure the history to show by default his N most 
recent transactions instead of 20 or to show all purchases made in the past N-day
window of time, he can specify this in the settings menu.
