Post Conditions: The users available balance will be updated with the all the transactions below the available balance. 

Main Success Scenario:
1. The user has logged in to their account successfully and navigates to the tab that has the button that says “Deposit Funds.”
2. The user clicks the button which takes them to another screen with a text box that asks them they amount of money they want to deposit.
3. The user enters the amount of money they want to deposit, or press the back button if the user accidentally presses the deposit button.
4. The user inputs a valid amount of money and presses the confirm button to confirm that they want to make the deposit. 
5. A dialog box pops up and the user selects “Yes” to confirm the deposit and the amount of money they deposit. 
6. The app takes the user back to the deposit page and updates their balance accordingly. 

Extension:
3. The user enters an invalid amount of money, a box pops up and says to enter a valid amount of money. 
5. If the user presses the “No” button the amount of money is not deposited and takes the user back to the deposit page with the text box and the “back” button.
6. If the user enters the wrong routing or checking number, a box pops up saying the transaction was invalid.
